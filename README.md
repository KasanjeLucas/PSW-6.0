# PSW-6.0
This is a project study that I made on a weekly event created by the Pythonando company, named as PyStack Week 6.0.


## Goals
With this project I was trying to evolve in python and the framework django (which one I never had experience with).
For this reason, some functions and the front-end part are simple.
In future, I intend to become better at these, but for the moment, I'm focusing on the back-end part.


## About the project
This is an event system that generate certificates and csv files that show who were the participants of the event.

## Installation
To run this code, you'll need a setup. This one is summed up on the file [requirements].

To install this in your system, first I recommend you to create an virtual enviroment (venv). To do this, just write on your terminal:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Then, it'll start automatically your virtual enviroment.

To install the libs needed, you'll need to do (on the terminal too):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion
Well, I think that's it. Enjoy the code (if it suits for you) and see ya!
